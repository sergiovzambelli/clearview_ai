# What is Clearview AI, in Reality

In fact, many European countries, faced with such ambitious claims, have questioned how this organization collects, manages, and uses data gathered online, and especially whether it adequately respects individuals' privacy.  

The investigations launched have revealed new details, highlighting that the tools used by Clearview AI are far from transparent or compliant with current regulations.  

### Key Issues Identified:

- **Data Collection and Retention:**  
  - The system saves images acquired from public sources in a proprietary database without subsequent updates.  
  - Retains images that may have been removed from the web.  

- **Biometric Data Processing:**  
  - Images are processed with algorithms to generate biometric data.  
  - Creates models capable of recognizing a person with extreme precision in any photograph.  

- **Metadata Extraction and Localization:**  
  - Biometric models are associated with information extracted from image metadata.  
  - This allows for a rough localization of the subject.  

### Privacy Concerns:

- Data is obtained through scraping publicly accessible images.  
- Individuals are not notified about the inclusion of their data.  
- No options are provided for:  
  - Requesting modifications.  
  - Deleting data.  
  - Objecting to inclusion in the database.  
- The company’s website lacks references to any of these possibilities.  

### Regulatory Actions in Europe:

In light of these practices, several European countries have taken action through their respective data protection authorities. Today, we will focus on the measures taken by the **Italian Data Protection Authority**.

# Origin, Accusation, and Response of Clearview AI

## Origin of the Investigation
The investigation against Clearview AI was initiated following news reports highlighting various issues related to the facial recognition products offered by the company.  

### Complaints Received by the Authority:
From February to July of 2021, the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) received four complaints from different individuals:  

1. **Three complaints regarding data processing without consent:**  
   - These complaints mentioned Clearview’s request for a copy of a personal identity document to process data access requests.  

2. **One complaint regarding lack of response to data access requests under Article 15 of the GDPR:**  
   - Despite two follow-up reminders on May 25 and June 18, 2021, Clearview failed to respond to data access requests.  

Additionally, the Garante received reports from privacy and human rights organizations concerning potential risks to individuals' rights and freedoms from Clearview’s data processing practices, especially in relation to law enforcement use of its products.

## Clearview AI's Defense: Jurisdiction Challenge
In response to a request for information sent by the Garante on March 9, 2021, Clearview argued that the GDPR did not apply to its activities for the following two main reasons:  

1. **No Services in Italy:**  
   - Clearview claimed that it does not offer products or services in Italy. It implements technical measures, such as IP blocking, to prevent access to its platform from devices in Italy.  

2. **No Monitoring Activity:**  
   - Clearview argued that the concept of "monitoring," as defined in Article 3, paragraph 2, letter b) of the GDPR, involves continuous and lasting observation, which it does not perform.  
   - The company stated that its services merely provide search results with links to third-party websites, offering a snapshot of search results at the time the search is conducted. Clearview compared this technology to a typical search operation, such as Google Search.  
   - Clearview further argued that it did not reference the GDPR in its privacy policy nor appoint a representative as required by Article 27, asserting that these provisions, and the regulation in general, do not apply to its activities.

# Response of Clearview AI: Defense and Arguments

On April 22, 2021, the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) notified Clearview AI of the initiation of proceedings regarding alleged violations of several provisions in the GDPR. These included Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a), b), and e), 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 22 of the Regulation.

Clearview AI presented its defense in a document submitted on June 22, 2021, which was summarized as follows:

1. **Closure of European Government Accounts (March 2020):**  
   - In response to complaints from European supervisory authorities, Clearview closed and deactivated trial accounts from European government agencies, even though these accounts were limited in number.

2. **No Clients in the European Union:**  
   - Clearview asserted that, at the time of the proceedings, it had no clients in the European Union, as all access from European IP addresses had been blocked.

3. **Responsibility of Clients:**  
   - According to Clearview's software terms of use, it is the client's responsibility to ensure the legitimate use of the product in compliance with local regulations.

4. **Independent Investigations by Clients:**  
   - Clearview requires its clients to conduct their own further investigations and avoid making decisions based solely on the data provided by Clearview's software.

5. **Inapplicability of Article 3, Paragraph 2:**  
   - Clearview, based in the U.S., argued that it does not have any branch within the European Union, and therefore, the GDPR does not apply. The company claimed that it does not offer goods or services to European clients.

6. **Monitoring of Data Subjects (Article 3, Paragraph 2, Letter b)):**  
   - Clearview referred to Recital 24 of the GDPR, which defines monitoring as the tracking of natural persons on the internet, particularly for profiling purposes to analyze or predict preferences, behaviors, and attitudes. The company argued that it does not monitor individuals in this manner.

7. **No Behavioural Profiling or Tracking:**  
   - Clearview claimed that it does not analyze the behavior of data subjects or create profiles related to individuals. The sole purpose of its service is to provide a search engine for image searches. The facial vectors used by Clearview are not linked to any individual identifiers and cannot be used to infer information about a person.

8. **No Intent or Capacity for Behavioural Analysis:**  
   - Clearview further argued that for data processing to be considered monitoring, it must involve profiling techniques or behavioral analysis, which it neither intends nor is technically capable of performing.

9. **Collection of Data is Not Equivalent to Monitoring:**  
   - Clearview emphasized that merely collecting data, even in large volumes, does not automatically constitute monitoring.

10. **WP251 Guidelines on Profiling:**  
    - Clearview cited the WP251 guidelines, which describe profiling activities in three phases: data collection, automated analysis, and the application of the analysis to an individual. While Clearview's system may involve the first two phases, it argued that the third phase—applying the analysis to predict future behaviors—is beyond the scope of its software or business model. The Swedish authority, in particular, concluded that the Swedish police, as the customer of Clearview's software, were the data controllers and operated independently.

11. **Clarification on Profiling and Monitoring:**  
    - Clearview reiterated that Article 3, paragraph 2, letter b) applies specifically to monitoring behavior and the analysis of behavioral habits, which is not the objective of Clearview's operations.

12. **Request for Identity Verification:**  
    - In response to a claim from a complainant requesting a copy of their identity document, Clearview explained its policy for data access requests. The company requires a photo from an official identity document to verify the requester's identity. Since Clearview cannot verify individuals in its image database by name alone, it considers this requirement necessary to prevent fraudulent requests, in line with Article 12, paragraph 6 of the GDPR, which allows controllers to request additional information when there are reasonable doubts about the identity of the individual making the request.

# Clearview AI's Response to Additional Proceedings

Following the receipt of complaints from two natural persons on October 12, 2021, the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) initiated additional proceedings regarding alleged violations of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a), b), 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, and 27 of the GDPR. In response, Clearview AI submitted a defense on November 11, 2021, in which it reiterated its earlier arguments and provided the following points:

1. **No EU Operations or Jurisdiction:**  
   - Clearview reiterated that it does not operate in any EU Member State, does not monitor the behavior of data subjects within the EU, and therefore, no European authority, including the Garante, has jurisdiction over its activities.

2. **Non-Applicability of Article 3, Paragraphs 2 (a) and (b):**  
   - The company continued to argue that Article 3, paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of the GDPR do not apply to its operations. Clearview emphasized that it only provides an image search engine for law enforcement outside the EU and does not engage in monitoring activities that would require the extended observation of individuals.

3. **Search Engine Functionality and Limited Information:**  
   - Clearview argued that its search engine merely provides snapshots of photos available on the internet at the time of the search. The information gathered from these images is less significant than what can be obtained from a Google Search based on a person's name, and Clearview pointed out that no one argues that a Google Search constitutes behavioral monitoring.

4. **Role of Clearview as a Tool Provider:**  
   - Clearview emphasized that it is merely providing a tool for image searches and is not responsible for how users (law enforcement agencies) conduct searches or utilize the results. The company pointed out that national law enforcement agencies, rather than Clearview, were targeted in the proceedings by the Swedish and Finnish data protection authorities, recognizing these agencies as the data controllers.

5. **Request for Closure of Proceedings:**  
   - Given the lack of jurisdiction, Clearview requested that the Garante close the proceedings against the company.

6. **Comparison to Google Search and Lawful Processing:**  
   - Clearview argued that if Google's search engine, which operates within the EU and provides services to users there, is presumed to comply with European laws, then, if the GDPR were to apply to Clearview, the data processing performed by Clearview should also be considered lawful.

# Investigative Activity by the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante)

The investigation conducted by the Garante sought to examine Clearview AI’s response to the allegations and verify the accuracy of the company's claims in relation to its compliance with European data protection regulations.

## Response to Clearview's Claim of Similarity to Google Search

Clearview had claimed that its services were comparable to those of a standard search engine like Google Search. However, the Garante found this claim to be unfounded due to the following reasons:

1. **Specialized Service**:  
   - Clearview does not just make information available; it processes the data using a proprietary facial recognition algorithm, providing a highly specialized search service. This service is not publicly accessible but is restricted to specific categories of clients, further distinguishing it from standard search engines.
   
2. **Database Creation**:  
   - Unlike a typical search engine that indexes web pages, Clearview does not operate on a cached system. It creates a database of stored images that are not updated in real time based on their availability on the web.

3. **Biometric Processing**:  
   - Clearview processes images using biometric techniques, hashing, and metadata association, leading to the generation of biometric data. This processing falls under the enhanced protections of Article 9 of the GDPR, as the data generated can identify individuals and is classified as sensitive data under Article 4(1), No. 14.

## Infringement of Article 3 of the Regulation (Targeting)

The Garante also addressed the application of Article 3 of the GDPR, which governs the regulation's territorial scope, particularly with regard to the processing of personal data of EU citizens by companies not established in the EU.

- **Targeting of European Citizens**:  
   - While Clearview does not have an establishment in the EU, the Garante found that the criteria for "targeting" in Article 3(2) of the GDPR do apply. The investigation concluded that Clearview processes the personal data of European and Italian citizens. This was confirmed by responses provided by Clearview to data subjects and evidence gathered from other proceedings initiated by European supervisory authorities.
   
   - Therefore, despite Clearview's claims, the company is considered to be "targeting" individuals in the EU, and the processing of their personal data falls within the scope of the GDPR.

## Referring to Article 3(2)(a):

Clearview claims not to provide services in Europe and to have no European clients, but this is contradicted:

- **Swedish DPA Decision**: A recent decision by the Swedish Data Protection Authority (DPA) found that national law enforcement had used Clearview’s service.
- **Restrictions on European Accounts**: Clearview implemented restrictions on European accounts in 2020, suggesting that such accounts existed prior to that date.
- **Intent to Offer Services**: Clearview must have indicated, through its conduct, the intention to offer goods or services to individuals in the Union (Recital 23). This is evidenced by:
    - **Changes to Privacy Policy**: On March 20, 2021, Clearview updated its privacy policy following the notification from the Italian DPA on March 9. The policy at that time included references suggesting an intent to provide services within the Union, aligning with Article 6.
    - **Specific Clauses**:
        - Independent Recourse
        - International Transfers
    - **Terms of Service**: The Terms of Service referred to users beyond law enforcement clients, further supporting the intent to provide services to a broader audience.

## Referring to Article 3(2)(b):

Data processing related to monitoring individuals' behavior. As clarified by Recital 24:

> "To determine whether processing activities involve monitoring the behavior of data subjects, it is necessary to ascertain whether individuals are tracked on the internet, including through subsequent data processing techniques involving profiling of the individual, particularly to make decisions about them or to analyze or predict their preferences, behaviors, and personal attitudes."

- **Guidelines 3/2018**: The concept of "monitoring" requires assessing whether tracking occurs and if profiling techniques are subsequently employed.
- **Evolution of Data**: The information collected is updated and enriched over time to document changes in the individual, creating a repository of resources that evolves chronologically. This form of data archiving may correspond to monitoring the behavior of data subjects.
- **Clearview's Patent**: Clearview’s patent explicitly describes the system’s capacity to:
    - Gather accurate information about individuals and evaluate specific characteristics.
    - Conduct evaluation activities during the matching phase, in addition to any user-specific purposes.
- **Profiling**: Profiling occurs under Article 4(1), No. 4.

**Conclusion**: Article 3(2) is therefore applicable.

# Referring to Competence of the Italian DPA:

The Italian Authority's jurisdiction is applicable because Clearview AI does not have an establishment in Europe. Under **Article 55(1)**:

- **Use of the System**: The potential use of Clearview’s system to gather accurate personal information and evaluate specific characteristics establishes grounds for oversight by the Italian DPA.

# Referring to Existence of Personal Data Processing:

An image qualifies as personal data if it enables the identification of an individual, pursuant to **Article 4(1), No. 1**.

Clearview AI’s activities constitute processing because:

- **Public Availability Does Not Justify Use**: The fact that data is publicly available online does not justify its use without a legal basis. Publication of data does not inherently permit its reuse, as it is bound by the original purpose for which it was made public.
- **Warnings for Data Scraping**: Clearview AI has received warnings from online services for scraping data in violation of their terms of service.
- **Legal Basis for Collection**: The collection of such data requires a legal basis under **Article 6** of the Regulation.
- **Beyond Processing**: Clearview’s operations go beyond simple data processing; they also include additional activities, such as:
    - **Vectorization**: Converting ordinary images into vectorized representations (facial images, i.e., biometric data).
    - **Metadata Association**: Associating these images with metadata, which may contain sensitive personal data.

# Referring to Existence of Data Controllership:

Under **Article 4(1), No. 7**, a data controller determines the purposes and means of processing.

- **Clearview’s Role**: Clearview’s actions, such as collecting, storing, and processing data by placing it in a proprietary database, already constitute processing, independent of the activities of its tool users.
- **Privacy Policy Evidence**: The previous privacy policy included elements indicative of a data controller role, such as:
    - A **contact email** for data inquiries.
    - A **legal basis** for processing.
    - **Rights exercisable by data subjects**.
  
All these elements indicate that Clearview is acting as a data controller in its processing activities.

# Violations

## Infringement of Article 5(1)(a), (b), and (e) of the Regulation:

### 1. Violation of Legality, Fairness, and Transparency (Article 5(1)(a)):
- There has been a violation of the principles of legality, fairness, and transparency in the processing of data with respect to the data subjects, as outlined in **Recital 39** of the Regulation.
- Data subjects were not in contact with Clearview, were not directly informed of the activities being carried out, nor were they recipients of any related information, even when visiting the website.

### 2. Violation of Purpose Limitation (Article 5(1)(b)):
- The principle of purpose limitation has been violated. The public nature of the images does not grant the right to repurpose them for new objectives.
- Users who made the images public could not have reasonably expected them to be used in such a way by a private company, particularly one not based in the EU.

### 3. Violation of Storage Limitation (Article 5(1)(e)):
- The principle of storage limitation has been violated. There is no indication on the website or in the privacy policy of a retention period, nor is there any information in the complaints presented by the data subjects.
- This suggests that the images remain part of the database even after they are modified or deleted from the internet.

## Infringement of Article 6 of the Regulation:

The conditions under which data processing would be lawful are:

### 1. **Validity of the Legal Basis**:
- Clearview claims a legitimate interest in processing, implicitly comparing its activities to Google Search.
- The European Committee's position excludes the mere publication of images as sufficient to justify their reuse for other purposes.

### 2. **Excessive Intrusiveness and Privacy Concerns**:
- The data processing is for profit, intrusive to individuals' privacy, involves biometric processing, and concerns a large number of people, including images of minors.
- Clearview’s legitimate interest in economic freedom should be secondary to the risks it poses to individuals' rights to privacy, the principle of non-discrimination, and the prohibition on automated decision-making.

### Conclusion:
- Therefore, Clearview’s claimed legal basis for processing (legitimate interest) is not considered valid.


## Infringement of Article 9 of the Regulation:
- The images processed by Clearview become biometric data, which fall under the category of **special data** as defined in **Article 9**.
- This violation is aggravated because processing biometric data requires not only a legal basis but also more stringent protections, which were not respected by Clearview.

## Infringement of Articles 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the Regulation:

### 1. **Failure to Respond to Data Subject Requests (Article 12)**:
- The complaints to the authority were preceded by multiple requests from the data subjects to the data controller, asking for information on the data Clearview holds, as indicated in **Article 15**.
- The data subjects reported a lack of response, delays, or inadequate responses, in violation of **Article 12**. Specifically:
    - **Not all requested information** was clearly and explicitly provided. Only a file containing images extracted from the system (which could be linked to photographs provided by the data subjects along with their identification documents) was sent. For other requests, the data subjects were simply directed to a generic link to the company’s privacy policy.
    - The response was provided **beyond the 30-day period** prescribed by **Article 12**.

### 2. **Excessive Data Requested**:
- **Excessive requests** for data, such as identification documents, were made in order to process the access request.
- The doubts that may have led to the request for identification documents were deemed **unreasonable**. The images and information already provided by the data subjects were deemed sufficient, and any further doubts could have been resolved through other means.

### Conclusion:
- Clearview’s failure to provide timely and adequate responses to data subject requests violates the requirements set forth in Articles 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the Regulation.

## Infringement of Articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation:
- Under **Articles 13** and **14**, the information provided about data processing must be complete, accurate, and up-to-date.
- Clearview's privacy policy changed between the first and second complaints. The updated policy:
    - No longer references the **European Union**, only mentioning **California**.
    - Introduces a **maximum annual request limit** of two and modifies response times, making them **longer** than those required by European law.
- The previous policy, which included references to **Article 13**, was insufficient as it lacked essential details, such as:
    - Specifying the **legitimate interest** pursued by the data controller.
    - Clarifying the **data retention period**.
- These deficiencies apply to both data **directly collected** from users and data **indirectly collected** (Articles 13 and 14).

## Infringement of Article 27 of the Regulation:
- Since **Article 3(2)** is applicable, Clearview is required to appoint a representative in the EU.
- As established, **Clearview processes personal data** of individuals within the EU, and its activities are linked to providing services to European users, as well as monitoring their behavior.
- The **failure to designate a representative** constitutes a violation of **Article 27**.

## Infringement of Article 22 of the Regulation:
- A potential violation under **Article 22** was considered due to the possibility that the processing might involve **automated decision-making**, even if only partially automated.
- However, the investigation did not yield **specific evidence** regarding automated decision-making and it appears that the decision-making process is more attributable to the **users** of the service rather than Clearview itself.
- **Therefore, this issue has been withdrawn**.

### Conclusion:
- Clearview’s failure to ensure complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about data processing, the lack of an EU representative, and the possible automated decision-making practices are significant violations of the GDPR.

---

## Conclusions

Based on the evaluations described, it is clear that the Garante confirmed the unlawful nature of Clearview AI’s processing of personal data. The violations were found to involve the following articles of the GDPR:
- **Articles 5(1)(a), (b), and (e)**
- **Article 6**
- **Article 9**
- **Articles 12, 13, 14, and 15**
- **Article 27**

### Orders Issued by the Garante:
1. **Prohibition on Web Scraping**: Clearview is prohibited from further collecting images and related metadata through web scraping techniques concerning individuals located in **Italian territory**.
2. **Prohibition on Processing Data**: Clearview is prohibited from conducting any further processing of **common and biometric data** related to individuals located in Italy through its **facial recognition system**.
3. **Deletion of Data**: A general order has been issued for the **deletion** of all data that was previously collected and processed by the Company, affecting all relevant data subjects.
4. **Appointment of an EU Representative**: Clearview is required to appoint, within **thirty days**, a representative in **Italy** to act as an intermediary for data subjects and facilitate the exercise of their rights under the GDPR.
5. **Compliance Report**: Clearview must inform the Garante, within **thirty days** from the notification of this decision, about the measures taken to comply with the orders and actions undertaken to facilitate the exercise of data subjects’ rights.

### Potential for Administrative Fines:
In addition to the corrective measures, the Garante retains the power to impose an **administrative fine** as per **Articles 58 and 83 of the Regulation** and **Article 166 of the Italian Privacy Code**.

## Fine Assessment under Article 83(2)

To determine the amount of the fine, the Garante considered the factors listed in **Article 83(2)** of the GDPR:

1. **Nature of the Processed Data**:
    - The data processed by Clearview AI includes **biometric data**, which is classified as a special category of data. This includes sensitive information, potentially involving minors, and requires higher levels of protection under the Regulation.

2. **Severity and Duration of the Violation**:
    - Clearview AI violated **Articles 6 and 9**, which govern the lawful processing of data, particularly in relation to biometric data. 
    - The violations are considered **severe** because they pertain to **mass surveillance** and the use of biometric data for facial recognition purposes, activities that are deemed particularly illegitimate by European and Italian legislators.
    - The violation was **ongoing**, as the company continued its processing activities even after ceasing to offer services to clients within the EU.

3. **Number of Data Subjects Involved**:
    - While the **exact number** of affected individuals is difficult to determine, the large-scale collection of images via **web scraping** suggests that a **significant number** of people, particularly in Italy, were impacted. 
    - This likely includes a large portion of individuals with an online presence, whether on **social media** or other platforms where their images were publicly available.

4. **Degree of Responsibility of the Data Controller**:
    - The **degree of responsibility** of Clearview is **high**. Despite repeated interventions by European and non-European data protection authorities, Clearview has continued its unlawful processing activities.
    - The company’s **defensive stance** against European jurisdiction and its refusal to comply with the Regulation demonstrates a **high level of responsibility** in perpetuating the violations.
    - Clearview further exacerbated the situation by **modifying its privacy policy** in March 2021 to remove any reference to the GDPR, showing a lack of commitment to regulatory compliance.

5. **Measures Adopted by the Data Controller**:
    - Despite the Garante’s interventions and those of other authorities, Clearview did not adopt any corrective measures to comply with the Regulation. 
    - This lack of corrective action and the **modification of the privacy policy** to exclude references to the Regulation after 2021 indicates that the company did not make efforts to align its activities with the GDPR.

6. **Degree of Cooperation with the Supervisory Authority**:
    - Clearview has **failed to cooperate** effectively with the Garante and other supervisory authorities. 
    - The company continuously denied the applicability of the GDPR to its activities and did not provide detailed responses to requests made by the data subjects, undermining the authority of the supervisory bodies.

### Mitigating Factor:
- The **absence of prior violations** and any **previous measures** taken against Clearview could be considered a mitigating factor. However, this is outweighed by the severity of the current violations and the company's ongoing non-compliance.

### Conclusion:
Given the high severity, wide impact, and Clearview’s lack of cooperation, the Garante has significant grounds to impose a **substantial administrative fine** in accordance with the principles outlined in Article 83(2).

## Conclusion: The Future of Clearview AI and AI Systems in the EU

Considering all the factors mentioned above, and under the provisions of **Article 83(3)** of the GDPR, the **maximum administrative fine** for Clearview AI's violations of **Articles 5(1)(a), (b), and (e), 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 27** has been set at **20 million euros**. The **severity** of the violations, along with the **particularly sensitive nature** of the data processed, justifies this fine.

Additionally, the **public nature** of the decision reinforces the message. Therefore, it was deemed necessary to publish this decision on the Garante’s website to ensure transparency and present this case to the wider public.

### A Darker Future for Clearview AI

However, there is more to the story. Recently, the **European Union** published its **first comprehensive AI regulation**, marking a significant milestone in the global regulation of AI technologies. This new regulation addresses the critical challenges posed by AI systems, particularly **General-Purpose models**, and the potential risks they present.

In relation to Clearview AI, and possibly motivated by its case, **Article 5** of the regulation on **Prohibited AI Practices** provides an important reference:

**Article 5(1)(e)** prohibits the following AI practices:
- The placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems that **create or expand facial recognition databases** through **untargeted scraping** of facial images from the internet or **CCTV footage**.

This regulation directly targets practices like those carried out by Clearview AI, which involves scraping images from the web without the knowledge or consent of the individuals concerned.

### Recital (43): The Rationale Behind the Regulation

**Recital (43)** further clarifies why such practices are prohibited:
> “The placing on the market, the putting into service for that specific purpose, or the use of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, should be prohibited because that practice adds to the feeling of **mass surveillance** and can lead to **gross violations of fundamental rights**, including the **right to privacy**.”

This recital highlights the critical concerns surrounding **mass surveillance** and the **invasion of privacy** associated with facial recognition systems built from scraped images. The EU is actively addressing these issues, recognizing that such systems can lead to violations of individuals' fundamental rights.

### Our Role as Cybersecurity Students

As students of **cybersecurity**, we understand the immense power that AI holds and the potential consequences when such technologies are misused. With great power comes great responsibility. The European Union’s regulatory efforts show a clear commitment to protecting citizens' **right to privacy** by curbing the development and use of invasive AI technologies like facial recognition systems built through untargeted scraping.

In conclusion, we can all take pride in living in a state that actively works to prevent **mass surveillance** systems and ensures that our **privacy rights** are respected in the digital age. The actions taken by the Garante and the new EU AI regulations mark important steps in safeguarding our freedoms from invasive technologies.
